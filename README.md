# Programmables
Bouncing Shapes (Version v4u2r1)
This is the initial release. The way versions are numbered is the "v4" at beginning means version 4, the "u2" means content update 2, and "r1" is the revision 1. So you could say it is v4.2.1. I know it is not a normal start, but I have been working on it and adding things for a while (20-ish minutes, forgot its "this.x" not "x"...).
